Lyft Dataset Challenge Problems:

1. Recommend a Driver's Lifetime Value
	- this is based on the projected lifetime of a driver

	- Therefore, there are 2 parts to the problem:
		- What is the value produced by the driver.
		- What is the projected lifetime of the driver.

2. Additional Quesitons:
	- Main Factors is Lifetime Value:
		- things to include for analysis can be:
			- # of active years
			- frequency of ride
			- length of rides (time/distance)
			- does "speed" of accept-to-arrive improve performance
			- do drivers that drive mostly in prime time create more value
			- do drivers that take bigger/smaller fairs produce more value
			- do drivers that take bigger/smaller fairs last longer

	- Average Projected lifetime of a driver:
		- this is basically how long will the driver last once they get onboard

	- Characteristics of Value Creation:
		- What factors contribute are associated with high-amounts and low-amounts of value creation.

	- Actionable Recommendations for the business:
		- What characteristics of the driver/rides should Lyft push for in order to find the most value from their drivers.



There's 2 axis of analysis:
	1. How long with a driver last
	2. How much value does the driver create

Characteristics Open for Analysis:
	1. time active (most recent - onboard activity)
	2. # of rides (frequency of rides)
	3. Size of Rides:
		- distance of a ride
		- time of a ride
		- 
	4. Variance of rides types (only doing small or long rides, or doing many different types)
	5. Relationship between accept-to-arrive time
	6. Relative amount of time in prime time
	7. Size of fairs (does taking many small fairs do better than large fairs)
